Difficulty for one dev <image src="[https://progress-bar.dev/](https://progress-bar.dev/)20" />

This is a simple app aplying React + Spring Boot basics. No css processor or advanced management/interactions has been implemented (poor UX).

Main features:

- React hooks

- File system management
- Upload/Download file management
- A bit of css
